# Simple-Image-Compressor
A project that demonstrates image compression using the K-means algorithm in Python. The goal is to reduce the number of colors in an image from thousands to 16 (or K), enabling efficient representation and storage. The project includes steps for loading images, applying K-means clustering to find representative colors, and reconstructing the image using these colors.
